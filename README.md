Easy way to compile markdown into documents.

*NOTE: This is work in progress.
I have a new motivation to clean up this project.
Please let me know if you find it useful.*

This project is meant to make writing easier and more productive.

So you want to write a document.
Maybe you'll share it on the web.
Maybe you want a polished pdf. 
Maybe it's a blog, research paper, book draft, or just a set of notes.
You don't want to think about typesetting details.
You just want to throw your ideas in some plain text files and call `make`.


Quick start
----------------------------------

Installation:

I'll write installation instructions another time. For now, you can see
hints in how the GitHub runner does the installation in the CI:
[`workflows/ci-ubuntu.yml`](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-ubuntu.yml), 
[`workflows/ci-macos.yml`](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-macos.yml), and 
[`workflows/ci-windows.yml`](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml).

Starting a new document:

*Note: This will delete the markdown files in this example.*

```
make newdoc
```

Start writing with a text editor.
A first example file is created for you: `01-introduction.md`,
but you can structure your markdown files however you like.

When you are ready to make the document, call

```
make html
```

or

```
make pdf
```

*More explanation to come...*
