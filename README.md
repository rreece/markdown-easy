markdown-easy
===========================

[![CI badge](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy/actions)

Easy way to compile markdown into documents.

*NOTE: I have a new motivation to clean up this project.
Please let me know if you find it useful.*

This project is meant to make writing easier and more productive.

So you want to write a document.
Maybe you'll share it on the web.
Maybe you want a polished pdf. 
Maybe it's a blog, research paper, book draft, or just a set of notes.
You don't want to think about typesetting details.
You just want to throw your ideas in some plain text files and call `make`.
